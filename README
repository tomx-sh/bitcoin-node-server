To run the project during development, run `go run ./app`.


To build the project, run:
* `make build-local` for local build
* `make build-target` for target build


To run the project on the target, run the following command:
```bash
export ENV=production
export RPC_USERNAME=prod_username
export RPC_PASSWORD=prod_password
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8332
./dist/target/bitcoin-node-server
```

Or if you want to avoid setting the environment variables every time you run the project, you can
add them in your shell configuration file (e.g. ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
